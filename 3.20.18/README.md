*How do Bitcoin markets behave? What are the causes of the sudden spikes and dips in cryptocurrency values?  Are the markets for different altcoins inseparably linked or largely independent?  **How can we predict what will happen next?***

Articles on cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are rife with speculation these days, with hundreds of self-proclaimed experts advocating for the trends that they expect to emerge.  What is lacking from many of these analyses is a strong foundation of data and statistics to backup the claims.

The goal of this article is to provide an easy introduction to cryptocurrency analysis using Python.  We will walk through a simple Python script to retrieve, analyze, and visualize data on different cryptocurrencies.  In the process, we will uncover an interesting trend in how these volatile markets behave, and how they are evolving.

Instead, all that we are concerned about in this tutorial is procuring the raw data and uncovering the stories hidden in the numbers.
