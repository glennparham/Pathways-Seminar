Interactive labs for a graduate class in the School of Information, exploring techniques, risks, and the moral hazards that come with stripping data of personally identifying information, and the potential reidentification of individuals for supposedly "deidentified" data. The module is broken into two parts:


1. Identifying Daredevil from simulated data sets
2. Clustering target groups from Instacart data [[DataHub link]](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=ds-modules&repo=INFO-290&branch=master&path=instacart_profiling/Identifying%20Groups%20of%20People%20Using%20Instacart%20Data.ipynb)
