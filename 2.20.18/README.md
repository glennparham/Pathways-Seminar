===============


[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library for doing
data analysis. It's really fast and lets you do exploratory work
incredibly quickly.

Pandas is considered a "framework" (similar to the "Datascience" framework that we used in Data 8).  Pandas and Datascience are in some ways conceptually similar; however, syntactially different.
